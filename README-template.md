## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vite
- Javascript
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I have learned a handful of new conecpts and techniques. Using picture elemets along with source elements using srcset attribute was a useful technique to only render images that work best for the user's device which is great for website performance.

### Continued development

Still learning how to make responisve layouts and components, especially images. After doing media queries, I have noticed I had to write too many every 100px or so. So this project help me realize I need to write more effective and effiecient ways to make more responsive layouts and components.
